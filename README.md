# How to run video app #

PeerJS wraps the browser's WebRTC implementation to provide a complete, configurable, and easy-to-use peer-to-peer connection API. Equipped with nothing but an ID, a peer can create a P2P data or media stream connection to a remote peer <https://peerjs.com/>

## How to run app ##

Open a terminal and go to `peerjs-video-app` directory:

Run npm install

## Generate your certificates ##

In terminal open cert folder, delete cert.pem and key.pem files
After that run this four commands to generate certificates:
openssl genrsa -out key.pem
openssl req -new -key key.pem -out csr.pem
openssl x509 -req -days 9999 -in csr.pem -signkey key.pem -out cert.pem
rm csr.pem
